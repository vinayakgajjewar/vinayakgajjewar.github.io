# About me

I'm Vinayak, a Ph.D. student at UC Santa Barbara co-advised by [Chandra Krintz](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~ckrintz/) and [Rich Wolski](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~rich/). I have previously workeded with [Ahmed Eldawy](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eldawy/) at UC Riverside.

My research focuses on enabling spatial computing in low-energy and failure-prone environments.
